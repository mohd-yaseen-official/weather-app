# 🌤️ Weather App

A beautifully crafted weather app built with React Native. This project is entirely **UI-based**, using **static/mock data** to simulate a real-world weather application. It focuses on showcasing layout design, user interface structure, and component styling without relying on live APIs or real-time data.

- 📍 Displays city-specific weather conditions (static mapping)
- 🌦️ Visual representation of current weather

- 📊 Widgets for multiple locations

---

## 📦 Tech Stack

- **React Native**
- **JavaScript**
- **Styled Components / Custom CSS**
- **Static JSON or State Mapping**

## ⚠️ Note

This is a **UI prototype**. The app does **not** fetch live weather data or interact with any backend services. All displayed information is hardcoded or mapped via static state.
